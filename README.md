# Gathering Gigahub Modem Attributes (DM#, SMB#, SGC#)

1. Grab your device DM## and SMB## values from the back of your Gigahub modem:

   <a href="./doc-assets/images/gigahub-modem-back-shot.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/gigahub-modem-back-shot.png" alt="Gigahub Modem Back Shot" width="25%"/>
   </a>

2. Identify the firmware version your Gigahub is currently running

   1. Log into your Gigahub and find your Firmware version ([accessing your Gigahub Web UI](https://forum.bell.ca/t5/Internet/Questions-about-GigaHub-modem-get-version-retrieve-password-won/m-p/22480/highlight/true#M6316)):

# Connecting the WAS-110

## SFP Switch Method

Accessing the WAS-110 via a switch is possible if you have a 10G switch ready to go.

<!-- image reference to was-110-connectivty-via-switch.png -->
<a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-connectivty-via-switch.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-connectivty-via-switch.png" alt="WAS-110 Connectivity via Switch" width="50%"/>
</a>

Some switches require you to have the fibre connected to establish a link. After you have the custom firmware, you can setup the WAS-110
to link without fibre connected (see [FAQ](#frequently-asked-question-faq)).

## Media Converter Method

If you don’t have a switch or the switch is not linking with your WAS-110, a media converter will work instead.

<!-- image reference to was-110-connectivty-via-media-converter.png -->
<a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-connectivty-via-media-converter.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-connectivty-via-media-converter.png" alt="WAS-110 Connectivity via Media Converter" width="50%"/>
</a>

# Accessing the WAS-110

1. Confirm you can access the WAS-110 by pinging it from your client device/virtual machine:

   <a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-ping-confirmation.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-ping-confirmation.png" alt="WAS-110 Access Ping Confirmation" width="50%"/>
   </a>

2. Go to [http://192.168.11.1](http://192.168.11.1) login with `admin` and password `QsCg@7249#5281`:

   <a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-web-ui.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-web-ui.png" alt="WAS-110 Access Web UI" width="50%"/>
   </a>

3. Go to the Service tab and tick the box on SSH:

   <a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-web-ui-ssh.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-web-ui-ssh.png" alt="WAS-110 Access Web UI SSH" width="50%"/>
   </a>

4. Start up a terminal and SSH into the WAS-110 with login `root` and password `QpZm@4246#5753`:

   - Linux
     - `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.11.1`
   - Windows 11
     - `ssh root@192.168.11.1`

   <a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-ssh-windows.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-access-ssh-windows.png" alt="WAS-110 Access Web UI SSH" width="50%"/>
   </a>

   - If you had logged into the stick and it rebooted on you, you’ll have to clear your known_hosts file otherwise you’ll get an error since the WAS-110’s SSH RSA fingerprint key changes after every reboot.

# Checking for WAS-110 issues

Check for issues on the WAS-110 by running the command below and ensuring that it returns nothing:

```shell
VOLS="kernelA bootcoreA rootfsA kernelB bootcoreB rootfsB rootfs_data ptconf" ; i=0; for VOL in $VOLS; do
VOLID=$(ubinfo /dev/ubi0 -N "$VOL" 2>/dev/null | grep 'Volume ID:' | awk '{print $3}'); [ -z "$VOLID" ] && echo
"Volume $VOL missing" || [ "$VOLID" -eq "$i" ] 2>/dev/null || echo "Volume $VOL misplaced (should be ID $i, not
$VOLID)"; i=$((i+1)); done
```

If you're on a Bell 3.0gbps plan or above, you're on VEIP.

# Setting WAS-110 Firmware Variables

## PPTP or VEIP

You need to know if you're on PPTP or VEIP. Check up-n-atom's guide on Discord ([link](https://discord.com/channels/886329492438671420/1162279893388759122/1178570504496496692)).

## Applying the Variables

1. Ensure no issues are coming up with the WAS-110 (see [here](#checking-for-was-110-issues))
2. Issue the following commands while SSHed into the WAS-110 (replace your DM## , SMB##, and SGC## where applicable:

   ```shell
   # mib_file
   fw_setenv mib_file
   fw_setenv mib_file

   # 8311_device_sn
   # Replace DM############# with your DM## value from the back of your modem

# Upgrading the WAS-110 to Custom Firmware

1. Ensure no issues are coming up with the WAS-110 (see [here](#checking-for-was-110-issues))
2. Download the latest firmware from the 8311 Discord Server ([link](https://discord.com/channels/886329492438671420/1162279893388759122/1178570504496496692))
3. Extract `local-upgrade.img` from the archive file you just downloaded
4. On the WAS-110’s WEB UI:

   - Upgrade to the custom firmware (note: you have to do this twice):

     - Select `browse` and select the `local-upgrade.img` file
     - Select Upgrade
     - Module will reboot

     <!-- was-110-firmware-upgrade-webui.png -->
        <a href="./doc-assets/images/was-110-firmware-upgrade-webui.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="./doc-assets/images/was-110-firmware-upgrade-webui.png" alt="WAS-110 Firmware Upgrade Web UI" width="50%"/>
        </a>

   - After the module comes back up, ensure there are no issues (see [here](#checking-for-was-110-issues))
   - Add the failsafe file to the module to ensure we can recover it if something goes wrong:

     ```shell
     touch /ptconf/.failsafe
     ```

   - Repeat the firmware upgrade from the previous step (yes, you must do this twice)
   - After the module comes back up a second time, ensure there are no issues (see [here](#checking-for-was-110-issues))

5. Leave the WAS-110 plugged in and ensure it stays up for 5 minutes without rebooting, you can spam pings to 192.168.11.1 to see if the
   device stays up.
6. If all is good, you can remove the failsafe and reboot the stick:

   ```shell
   rm -f /ptconf/.failsafe
   reboot
   ```

# Fibre Connectivity to WAS-110

1. Plug the fibre into your WAS-110
2. In the WAS-110’s Web UI at Status → PON, ensure it shows an ONU State of O5.
   If it’s not showing O5, your fibre isn't connected properly

# PPPoE via the WAS-110

Using your choice of router (i.e. OPNSense, PFSense, Ubiquiti Dream Machine, etc.), setup PPPoE (b1id/password) like you normally
would’ve done with the Gigahub.

# Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)

## Internet VLAN - Untagged vs Tagged VLAN

The custom firmware will default to untagging the Internet VLAN for PPPoE.

If you still wish to have the Internet Service VLAN tagged to 35, check the djGrrr’s docs on Github ([link](https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder))

## No WAS-110 link to Switch with Custom Firmware and Fibre Disconnected

The WAS-110 asserts RX_LOS which some switches (e.g. Mikrotik) monitor to establish a link. You need to disable this.

1. Re-establish connectivity from the device that you previously SSHed the WAS-110 from
2. Issue the following SSH commands to update the 8311_rx_los variable to a value of 0
   ```shell
   fw_setenv 8311_rx_los 0
   fw_setenv 8311_rx_los 0
   ```
3. Reconnect the WAS-110 into the switch, you should now get a link even with the fibre disconnected

## Downloading the Custom Firmware

The latest custom firmware by djGrrr for the WAS-110 can be obtained from the 8311 Discord Community ([link](https://discord.com/channels/886329492438671420/1162279893388759122/1178570504496496692)).
